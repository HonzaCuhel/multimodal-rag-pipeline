## Installation

```bash
# Activate a python environment of your choice (e.g. venv, Conda)
# ...
# Install the dependencies
pip intall -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution

```bash
python multimodal_rag_pipeline.py --source_file manual.pdf
```

## Hardware requirements

We recommend to run this application on a device with a strong GPU as it utilizes several Deep Learning Models.

## Intended use

The intended use of the system is for vehicle manuals, but it can be used for different manuals as well.
